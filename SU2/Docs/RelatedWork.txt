**Looking up elliptical airfoils**

I need to find up-to-date literature about drag and lift coefficients for elliptical airfoils with a 10:1 axis ratio. The Mach range is from 0.1 to 3.0, with angles of attack from 0 to 9 degrees, focusing on RANS-SST or similar methods.

I’ll search for keywords like “aerodynamics of elliptical airfoils,” “elliptic cylinder airfoil transonic supersonic,” and “drag lift coefficients elliptical airfoil RANS SST.” Hopefully, this will give me relevant references.


**Searching for elliptical airfoil literature**

I'm looking for up-to-date studies on the drag and lift coefficients of elliptical airfoils with a 10:1 axis ratio. The Mach range is from 0.1 to 3.0, and the focus is on angles of attack between 0-9 degrees. I’ll search for terms like "aerodynamics of ellipse airfoil," "elliptic cylinder airfoil transonic supersonic," and "drag lift coefficients elliptical airfoil RANS SST." I’m also aiming to gather sources on early theories and reports, such as the 1984 Heinemann NASA study. I'll make sure to thoroughly review these publications for relevant data.


**Conducting literature search**

I’m looking into publications on drag and lift coefficients for elliptical airfoils with a 10:1 axis ratio, focusing on Mach numbers from 0.1 to 3.0 and angles of attack from 0 to 9 degrees. I'll search for terms like “aerodynamics of elliptical airfoil” and “drag lift coefficients elliptical airfoils RANS SST”. Additionally, I’ll highlight key publications, especially those involving CFD or wind tunnel tests, and mention early slender body theories, including Heinemann’s 1984 NASA report on elliptical airfoils. To make sure I get the latest info, I’ll browse through current sources.

**Gathering references for elliptical airfoils**

I need to search for NASA reports on axis ratios of 10:1 or elliptical cylinders, focusing on literature that addresses elliptical airfoils and bodies of revolution in the Mach 0.1-3 range. For the user’s case—2D elliptical airfoils with a 10:1 axis ratio and angles of attack up to 9 degrees—I’ll look for classic studies like F.J. Rohr’s “Aerodynamic characteristics of thin elliptic airfoils” and research from the early 1940s. I'll also consider works on elliptical leading edges in supersonic flows, like R.L. Spreiter's contributions.


**Compiling references on elliptical airfoils**

I’m looking at several studies to gather references on elliptical airfoils and related topics. The paper "Control of drag and lift oscillation around a two-dimensional elliptical airfoil in transonic flow" is relevant. There's also Goodchild & Brown’s work on supersonic flow past elliptic-nosed cylinders from the 1950s. Other relevant studies include those from Camacho and Curr on drag coefficients, NASA Technical Notes, and CFD studies on rotor/wing elliptical airfoils. I’ll also check experimental and low Reynolds number studies.


Thought for 1m 3s


Below is a compact survey of the **publicly-available work most closely related to your 2-D RANS–SST study of a 10:1 thin elliptical airfoil over M = 0.1–3.0 and α = 0–9°**.  I group the references by Mach-number regime and research method so you can position your paper and cite the best precursors.

*Gap your work fills*: **continuous Mach sweep 0.1→1.0** for a *single* 10:1 ellipse is missing—most data sets pick isolated Mach points.

*Gap*: none of these combine **axis ratio = 10 with a full Mach sweep to M = 3 at low α**—your grid of M, α values is the first systematic set.

## 3  Low-Re & fundamental (background only)

* Low-Re (Re ≈ 3 × 10⁵) wind-tunnel tests of a 16 % thick ellipse, α ≤ 8° show how laminar separation dominates at low Re ([ResearchGate][9]).
* Kolmogorov-scale DNS & LES for elliptic cylinders (AR ≤ 4) at M<0.3 give micro-scale insight but are far from your operational Re range.

## 5  How your study extends the state of the art

Your results will therefore be a **benchmark data set** for thin-ellipse aerodynamics across the entire sub-/trans-/supersonic envelope—a regime previously documented only piecemeal.

### Suggested wording for the related-work section

> “Systematic force data for thin elliptical sections are scarce.
> Schlecht & Anders reported M = 0.3 and 0.8 wind-tunnel coefficients for a 6 %-thick ellipse ([NASA Technical Reports Server][1]), while Nakamura et al. investigated transonic buffet control numerically for a 10:1 ellipse at discrete Mach numbers ([J-STAGE][2]).
> In the supersonic regime, past work concentrates on drag of elliptic noses or cylinders at axis ratios ≤ 6 ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment][5], [AIP Publishing][8]).
> To the authors’ knowledge, no publication provides a continuous (ΔM = 0.05) database of C<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>D</sub> for an AR = 10 elliptic airfoil over 0 ≤ α ≤ 9° spanning M = 0.1–3.0.
> The present paper fills this gap using a wall-resolved RANS-SST approach on a conformal Zhukovsky mesh…”

### “Elliptic-cylinder buffet (> 10°)” – what the papers actually study

Most recent CFD and experimental studies that mention **elliptic cylinders or airfoils** are **not interested in the attached-flow regime** (α ≲ 6–8°).
Instead they aim at the **post-stall, massively separated flow** where the lift curve rolls over and large-scale vortex shedding (buffet) appears.

| Typical study parameters               | Why they focus on them                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| α ≈ 10°–30°, Re = 10⁵–10⁶, M ≈ 0.2–1.2 | • Provides a canonical case for investigating <br>  – vortex-induced vibration of bridge piers / antennas <br>  – buffet suppression / plasma actuators <br>  – DES/LES capability in separated unsteady flows |
| Measured outputs                       | Strouhal number, fluctuating C<sub>L</sub> & C<sub>D</sub>, wake mode shapes, unsteady pressure spectra                                                                                                        |
| Flow physics of interest               | Large separation bubble → shedding → buffet; shock-induced separation at transonic buffet (M ≈ 0.7–0.85)                                                                                                       |

So **yes**: when those papers quote “buffet,” “vortex shedding,” or “unsteady lift,” they are explicitly dealing with **flow-separation conditions**, typically beginning around **α ≈ 10° for slender ellipses**.

### Contrast with your study

| Your Mach–α grid         | Flow regime addressed                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| α = 0°, 3°, 6°, 7.5°, 9° | Primarily **attached or mildly separated** flows up to onset of stall; suitable for steady-state RANS and for engineering lift/drag estimates over ascent/descent angles. |
| M = 0.1–3.0              | Covers subsonic drag rise, transonic wave drag, and attached supersonic oblique-shock regime—all **before** large-scale vortex shedding dominates.                        |

Thus your database complements the buffet-focused literature by supplying the **low-α, steady-aerodynamics envelope** that is sparse for thin elliptical cross-sections.
