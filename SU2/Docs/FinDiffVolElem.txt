Although **finite difference (FD)** and **finite volume (FV)** methods can both be used to solve the Navier–Stokes equations—and often produce similar results in practical CFD codes—they are **conceptually** and **formally** different in a few key ways:

---

## 1. Governing Principle

1. **Finite Difference (FD)**  
   - Directly approximates the partial derivatives (e.g., \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\)) at discrete grid points.  
   - Originates from a **Taylor expansion** perspective, where you replace derivatives by difference quotients (e.g., \(\frac{u_{i+1}-u_i}{\Delta x}\), \(\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}\), etc.).  
   - Typically formulated on (often structured) grids, especially *uniform or smoothly varying* meshes.

2. **Finite Volume (FV)**  
   - Enforces **conservation** laws over small control volumes (cells).  
   - Integrates the Navier–Stokes equations in flux form: \(\int \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}\, dV = \oint \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS\).  
   - The solution “lives” in the cell averages (or cell‐centered variables), and fluxes across cell faces are approximated.  
   - Very common in modern CFD, especially for **unstructured meshes** or complex geometries.

## 2. Conservation and Geometric Flexibility

- **Conservation**  
  - **Finite Volume** methods inherently conserve mass, momentum, and energy in each discrete cell by construction: the net flux out of one cell is the net flux into adjacent cells.  
  - **Finite Difference** methods, strictly speaking, do not automatically guarantee local conservation—though with careful arrangement, one can ensure a global flux balance on structured grids. On unstructured or very general grids, standard finite difference is less natural.

- **Geometric Flexibility**  
  - **Finite Volume**: Easily handles **arbitrary polyhedral cells** or complex domain boundaries (unstructured tetrahedra, prisms, polyhedra in 3D, etc.). Flux integrals are computed face by face.  
  - **Finite Difference**: Most straightforward on **structured meshes** (Cartesian or curvilinear). Extending to fully unstructured grids is more complicated (some do “finite difference–like” stencils, but truly flexible geometry is typically easier in FV).

---

## 3. Implementation in Navier–Stokes Solvers

1. **FD Solvers**  
   - Common in older or specialized CFD codes (e.g., NASA’s classic structured codes, some academic compressible flow solvers).  
   - Often simpler to code for uniform grids (just direct difference formulas).  
   - Derivative approximations can get tricky on complex boundaries or with body‐fitted coordinates.

2. **FV Solvers**  
   - Dominant in **commercial** and **open‐source** codes (e.g., ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM, SU2).  
   - Naturally handle shocks, discontinuities, and conservation.  
   - Readily adapt to unstructured or hybrid grids around complex geometries.

## 4. Do They Become “Essentially the Same” for Navier–Stokes?

- **On a structured, uniform mesh** in 2D or 3D, the **finite volume** flux approximations can look **very similar** to a **finite difference** stencil. In fact, for simpler flux schemes (like central differences), the two methods yield nearly identical formulae on structured grids.  
- However, **finite volume** keeps the integral form and a focus on fluxes across cell faces, while **finite difference** focuses on approximate derivatives at nodes.  
- Mathematically, you can show the equivalences under certain conditions, but **FV** remains explicitly conservative cell by cell, while **FD** is not necessarily so without additional constraints.

---

## 5. Which One to Choose?

- **Finite Volume** is the standard approach in modern **industrial CFD** due to its **local conservation** properties, ease of handling complex geometries, and robust shock‐capturing frameworks.  
- **Finite Difference** is still popular in certain **structured** or **high‐resolution** contexts (e.g., direct numerical simulation on rectangular domains, some academic compressible solvers). It can be computationally efficient for smooth grids.

---

### Bottom Line

- **They are not “the same,”** although for structured grids on simple domains you can often derive very similar discrete equations.  
- **Finite Difference**: Derivative-based, most natural on simple/structured grids, historically used in many compressible flow solvers.  
- **Finite Volume**: Flux-based, inherently conservative, and the method of choice for unstructured meshes and complex geometries—thus **widespread** in commercial CFD.

Below is a concise comparison of **Finite Element (FE)** methods alongside **Finite Difference (FD)** and **Finite Volume (FV)** in the context of **numerical Navier–Stokes solvers**:

---

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

1. **Finite Element (FE)**  
   - Originates in **variational** (weak) formulations: one typically writes the PDEs in an integral form (e.g., Galerkin, Petrov–Galerkin, etc.) and chooses basis functions (\(\phi_i\)) on each element.  
   - Unknowns are expansion coefficients in terms of these basis functions—solutions are piecewise polynomials over elements.  
   - Each element can be a triangle/tetrahedron or quadrilateral/hexahedron, etc. The method naturally handles unstructured meshes.

2. **Finite Difference (FD)**  
   - Direct approximation of **derivatives** at grid points via difference quotients.  
   - Traditionally more straightforward on **structured** (often uniform) meshes.  
   - Not inherently based on a variational principle—stability and consistency come from the Taylor expansions of derivatives.

3. **Finite Volume (FV)**  
   - Integrates PDEs over discrete **control volumes** (cells). Ensures local flux balance at cell faces—hence inherently **locally conservative**.  
   - Commonly used with **unstructured** or **hybrid** grids.  
   - Particularly popular for compressible flows and shock capturing, as the flux‐form PDE is discretized directly.

## 2. Treatment of Conservation

- **FE**:  
  - Standard Galerkin FE does not automatically guarantee a strict local conservation of mass, momentum, etc., at the element level (unless special formulations or flux‐based approaches are used).  
  - However, **discontinuous Galerkin (DG)** FE methods do enforce a flux form across element interfaces, blending FE accuracy with FV‐style local conservation.

- **FD**:  
  - Not inherently conservative. You can achieve global conservation on structured grids, but it is not a built-in feature in the same sense as FV.  

- **FV**:  
  - By design, each cell exactly balances fluxes in/out, guaranteeing **local** (and thus global) conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.

---

## 3. Geometric Flexibility

- **FE**:  
  - Extremely flexible. Works naturally with **unstructured** meshes (triangles, tetrahedra, quads, hexes, etc.).  
  - Large body of research on mesh adaptivity and error estimation in the FE community.

- **FD**:  
  - Most straightforward on **Cartesian or curvilinear structured** meshes. Extensions to unstructured frameworks exist but are less common.  

- **FV**:  
  - Also well‐suited to **unstructured** or **complex** geometries, widely used in engineering applications with intricate domains.

---

## 4. Accuracy and Order of Approximation

- **FE**:  
  - Can achieve very high orders of accuracy using higher‐order polynomial basis functions (p‐refinement) and local mesh refinement (h‐refinement).  
  - Adaptive FE methods allow local control of mesh density based on error indicators.

- **FD**:  
  - Generally straightforward to go from 2nd‐order to 4th‐ or 6th‐order on structured grids.  
  - Accuracy on irregular or unstructured domains is more complicated to maintain.

- **FV**:  
  - Commonly 2nd‐order accurate in practice, but can be extended to higher order using **reconstruction** techniques (MUSCL, WENO, etc.).  
  - Achieving very high order on unstructured grids is more complex but is an active research area (e.g., DG or spectral FV methods).

## 5. Typical Applications & Popularity

1. **FE**:  
   - Dominant in **structural mechanics** and **solid mechanics** for decades. In fluid dynamics, classical continuous Galerkin FE is popular for incompressible or low‐Mach flows (e.g., finite element solvers for laminar or turbulent incompressible).  
   - **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)** has grown in popularity for **compressible** flows, combining local conservation with higher‐order polynomial accuracy and unstructured flexibility.  
   - Also widely used in **multiphysics** problems where coupling fluid flows with solids or heat conduction is necessary.

2. **FD**:  
   - Historically used in many **academic** or **structured‐grid** compressible solvers (e.g., early NASA codes).  
   - Still used in **DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation)** or **LES** for turbulent flows in simpler domains (channel flows, boundary layers) due to the efficiency of high‐order finite differences on rectangular meshes.

3. **FV**:  
   - The **most common** approach in **commercial and open‐source CFD codes** (Fluent, OpenFOAM, SU2, ANSYS CFX, STAR-CCM+). Robust shock capturing and local conservation are key for compressible, turbulent, or multiphase flows in complex geometries.

   - Formulated from a **variational perspective**.  
   - Great **geometric flexibility**, easily extended to **high‐order** with polynomial basis functions.  
   - Classical continuous FE is not strictly locally conservative, but **discontinuous Galerkin** FE can match FV’s conservation property.

2. **Finite Difference**  
   - **Derivative approximations** via difference quotients.  
   - Typically relies on **structured grids**, easy to code but not inherently conservative.  
   - Favored for simple domains or specialized high‐order simulations.

3. **Finite Volume**  
   - **Flux balancing** across each cell face ensures **local conservation** by design.  
   - Supports **unstructured grids**, widely used in industry and research for complex, viscous, and compressible flows.  
   - Usually 2nd‐order accurate in practice, can go higher with reconstruction or advanced schemes.

In modern CFD for **complex geometries** and **robust handling** of shocks or boundary layers, **finite volume** and **finite element** (especially DG variants) are the two most commonly adopted. **Finite difference** remains popular in certain specialized or academic contexts (like direct simulations of turbulence on rectangular grids).
