### 1.  Governing levels

| “Level”                       | Unknowns you solve for                            | Governing equations                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instantaneous (DNS / LES)** | instantaneous ρ, u, v, w, T                       | Navier–Stokes **exactly as derived** from conservation + Newtonian stress                |
| **Reynolds‑averaged (RANS)**  | *time‑ (or ensemble‑) averaged* ρ̄, ū, v̄, w̄, T̄ | Average the N‑S equations → new **Reynolds‑stress and turbulent‑heat‑flux terms** appear |

So the *mass/momentum/energy conservation statements are identical*, but **the Reynolds decomposition introduces extra unknown correlations** that do **not** appear in the classical laminar NS equations.

---

### 2.  How the extra terms arise

For velocity:

$$
u_i = \,\bar{u}_i + u_i' ,
\quad
\overline{u_i'} = 0 .
$$

Insert into the instantaneous momentum equation, average in time (or ensemble):

$$
\underbrace{\rho\,
\bigl(\bar{u}_j \partial_j \bar{u}_i\bigr)}_{\text{convective term}}
+ \partial_i \bar{p}
- \underbrace{\partial_j
\bigl(\mu\,\partial_j \bar{u}_i\bigr)}_{\text{molecular viscous stress}}
= 
\color{darkred}{-\partial_j\bigl(\,\rho\,\overline{u_i' u_j'}\bigr)}
$$

* **Left‑hand side =** laminar Navier–Stokes terms (built from *averaged* variables).
* **Right‑hand side (red) =** divergence of the **Reynolds‑stress tensor**

$$
R_{ij}= \rho\,\overline{u_i' u_j'} .
$$

Exactly the same averaging of the energy equation produces the **turbulent heat flux**
$\overline{u_j' T'}$.

### 3.  Closure problem

| Item      | Laminar NS                             | RANS                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unknowns  | ρ, u, v, w, T (5)                      | ρ̄, ū, v̄, w̄, T̄ **+ 6 Reynolds stresses + 3 heat‑flux comps …** |
| Equations | 5 conservative PDEs (+ state equation) | same 5 PDEs **but now with $\mathbf{R}$ and $\overline{u'T'}$**   |
| Situation | closed                                 | **under‑determined → need a model**                               |

Hence RANS ≠ “just NS with a different stress tensor”; you have **additional tensors** that must be *modelled*, not calculated from first principles.

### 4.  Common closures

| Approach                                                                 | Idea                                                                                                                                                | Extra PDEs                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Eddy‑viscosity models** (SA, $k\!-\!\varepsilon$, $k\!-\!\omega$, SST) | Assume an *isotropic* turbulent viscosity $\mu_t$:<br>$R_{ij} = -\mu_t\bigl(\partial_j\bar u_i+\partial_i\bar u_j\bigr)+\tfrac23\rho k\delta_{ij}$. | 1–2 transport equations (for k, ω, ε, ν̃, …) |
| **Reynolds‑stress transport (RSM)**                                      | Solve transport equations for each $R_{ij}$.                                                                                                        | 6 additional PDEs (+ ε)                      |
| **Algebraic models / Wall functions**                                    | Relate $\mu_t$ or $R_{ij}$ to local variables via algebraic formulae (log‑law, mixing‑length, …).                                                   | none                                         |

So RANS adds a **closure layer** that can range from simple algebra to seven or more additional PDEs.

### 5.  Summary comparison

| Feature                    | Laminar / Instantaneous NS                            | RANS                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Variables                  | instantaneous fields                                  | time‑averaged fields                                         |
| PDE structure              | pure NS                                               | NS + divergence of $R_{ij}$ + turbulent heat flux            |
| # unknowns vs. # equations | balanced                                              | under‑determined → closure needed                            |
| Physical content           | all scales resolved (DNS) or partially resolved (LES) | only mean flow solved; turbulence effects inserted via model |

**Therefore:** The difference is **not merely** a tweaked viscous stress tensor; RANS introduces *new statistically averaged fluxes* that must be **modelled**, creating a distinct set of equations and additional transport/auxiliary equations absent from the classical laminar Navier–Stokes formulation.

Your reasoning captures the big picture:

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **(1) Solve the “raw” Navier–Stokes and time‑average afterward** | • If you retain *all* spatial and temporal scales you are doing **DNS**.<br>• If you retain large eddies but model the sub‑grid ones you are doing **LES** (or DES). | gives the most detailed physics; indispensable for fundamental turbulence research and some low‑Re engineering cases.                  | **Enormous**: grid spacing must be ≤ O( η ) (Kolmogorov scale) for DNS or fine enough to resolve inertial‑range eddies for LES.  At Re≈10^7 a full‑scale aircraft would need 10^11–10^14 cells and billions of time steps ⇒ petaflop‑years. |
| **(2) Solve the Reynolds‑averaged (RANS) equations directly**    | Mean fields (̄ρ, ū, k, ω…) plus a turbulence model that supplies the missing Reynolds stresses through an eddy viscosity μ\_t.                                       | Predicts *time‑averaged* forces, moments, surface pressures & heat loads for a vast range of external‑aero and internal‑flow problems. | **Cheap**: y^+≈1 wall mesh + 1–2 extra PDEs.  A 3‑D aircraft at Re≈10^7 is tractable on hundreds of CPU cores in hours instead of petaflop‑years.                                                                                           |

So we almost always prefer (2) because **RANS compresses the turbulence information into one or two additional transport equations** instead of tens‑of‑billions of resolved degrees of freedom.

---

### Why the extra PDEs in RANS are still a bargain

* A typical 3‑D RANS‑SST run:

  * 20‑50 million cells × 7 unknowns ≈ 1‑3×10^8 DOFs.
  * Converges in 10^3–10^4 implicit iterations on an HPC node in a few hours.
* A comparable LES (let alone DNS) for the same Reynolds number would need **100–1000× more cells** *and* run unsteady for thousands of physical time units ⇒ months to years of wall time on a supercomputer.

Thus the cost of two extra scalar equations (k, ω) is negligible compared with the cost of resolving all turbulent eddies.

### When engineers still choose option (1)

| need                                                                                     | favourite approach                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detailed spectra, noise prediction, unsteady loads, jet screech, combustor instabilities | **LES / hybrid LES‑RANS**                                                        |
| Low‑Re benchmark flows, laminar–turbulent transition physics                             | **DNS** (or well‑resolved LES)                                                   |
| Stall / massively separated flows where steady RANS fails                                | **URANS** (time‑accurate RANS) or **DES** to capture large‑scale vortex shedding |

But for the **routine prediction of mean lift, drag, and pressure fields** on aircraft, turbines, rockets, cars, etc., **steady RANS remains the only affordable tool** at full Reynolds number on everyday hardware.

---

### Non‑stationarity in RANS

Even the mean flow can be unsteady (buffet, vortex shedding, rotating machinery, manoeuvres).
In such cases we still use the RANS closure but integrate the mean equations in **time‑accurate mode** (URANS).  The cost is far smaller than LES because the grid is still “RANS‑coarse” (no need to resolve the inertial cascade), yet we capture the large‑scale periodic behaviour.

---

### Bottom line

* **Option (1)** ⇒ DNS/LES gives exact or detailed turbulence physics but is astronomically expensive at practical Reynolds numbers.
* **Option (2)** ⇒ RANS introduces a handful of extra transport equations to *model* the effect of the unresolved turbulent eddies; that tiny algebraic/PDE overhead is *nothing* compared with the orders‑of‑magnitude savings in grid and time‑step requirements.
* Hence industry and most applied aerodynamics work almost always choose **RANS (steady or unsteady)** unless fine‑scale turbulence details are absolutely essential and the computational budget is huge.

### Heisenberg’s “eddy‐viscosity spectrum” (1948)

Werner Heisenberg proposed one of the first **spectral closures** for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence.  Starting from the Fourier‐space kinetic‑energy balance

$$
\frac{\partial E(k,t)}{\partial t}
=
T(k)\;-\;2\nu k^{2}E(k),
$$

he modelled the nonlinear transfer term $T(k)$ as a **scale‑dependent eddy viscosity**

$$
T(k)\;\approx\;-\,2\,\nu_{\!t}(k)\;k^{2}E(k),
\qquad
\nu_{\!t}(k)=
\left(\frac{1}{k^{2}}\int_{0}^{k} p^{2}E(p)\,dp\right)^{1/2}.
$$

With this ansatz he could integrate the spectrum analytically and recover the then‑new Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ inertial law plus a dissipative cut‑off.  **It is a single‑point, isotropic, homogeneous closure written in wavenumber space.**

---

## Why it is **not** used in modern engineering CFD

| Feature                                     | Heisenberg 1948                             | Practical RANS (e.g. SST)                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Underlying assumption                       | homogeneous, isotropic turbulence in a box  | wall‑bounded, inhomogeneous, often compressible flows                        |
| Mathematical setting                        | one ODE for $E(k)$ in spectral space        | PDEs in physical space (continuity, momentum, energy + turbulence transport) |
| Output                                      | energy spectrum only                        | mean velocity, pressure, temperature fields; surface forces & heat loads     |
| Dimensional closure                         | spectral eddy viscosity $\nu_t(k)$          | Boussinesq eddy viscosity $\mu_t = \rho\,a_1 k/\max(a_1\omega,S F_2)$        |
| Wall effects, pressure gradients, curvature | absent                                      | entered through damping / blending functions and extra source terms          |
| Implementation cost                         | analytic formula, but only for simple flows | 1–7 extra PDEs but solvable in complex 2‑D/3‑D geometries                    |

Because real aerodynamic flows are strongly **inhomogeneous and anisotropic**—boundary layers, separation, shocks—engineers need models formulated in **physical space** that can handle walls and varying length scales.  The Heisenberg closure does not provide that.

---

## Historical links to modern RANS models

*Heisenberg’s idea*—replace the nonlinear term by an **eddy viscosity proportional to an integral of energy**—was echoed in:

1. **Prandtl’s mixing‐length (eddy viscosity) hypothesis (1925)**
   $\nu_t = l_m^2|\partial u/\partial y|$
2. **Kolmogorov (1942) and Obukhov (1946)** energy cascade concepts
3. **k–ε model (Launder & Spalding, 1974)**
   $\nu_t = C_\mu\,k^2/\varepsilon$
4. **SST k–ω model (Menter, 1994)**
   $\nu_t = a_1\,k/\max(a_1\omega, S F_2)$

So the **philosophy**—represent unresolved motions by a viscosity–like term built from turbulence energy—remains, but the **details are very different**:

* Modern RANS models add **transport equations** for $k$, $\varepsilon$ or $\omega$ so they can adapt to inhomogeneous flows.
* Near‑wall damping/limiters, blending functions, curvature corrections etc. are all innovations absent in the 1940s spectral picture.

---

### Bottom line

Heisenberg’s closure was a milestone in theoretical turbulence but is **not used directly in present‑day CFD**.  Contemporary RANS models (e.g. SST) inherit the eddy‐viscosity *concept* yet add physical‑space transport equations and wall treatments to make them practical for complex, engineering‑scale, inhomogeneous flows.

### Kolmogorov’s **$k^{-5/3}$ inertial‑range spectrum**

In 1941 Andrei N. Kolmogorov proposed a statistical theory for **high‑Reynolds‑number, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence**.
One of its most famous results is the scaling of the **three‑dimensional kinetic‑energy spectrum** $E(k)$ in the wavenumber band that lies **between** the large, energy‑containing eddies and the very small, viscous (dissipative) eddies.

---

#### 1.  Assumptions

1. **Homogeneous & isotropic** turbulence in the statistical sense.
2. Very high Reynolds number → a broad *inertial sub‑range* where viscosity plays no direct role.
3. The only physical quantity that sets a scale in this inertial range is the **mean energy‑dissipation rate per unit mass** $\varepsilon$ (units: m² s⁻³).

---

#### 2.  Dimensional analysis

* Wavenumber $k$ (rad m⁻¹) ↔ length scale $\ell \sim 1/k$.
* Seek $E(k)$ such that dimensions match:

$$
[E(k)] = \bigl[\text{m}^3\,\text{s}^{-2}\bigr],
\quad
[\varepsilon] = \bigl[\text{m}^2\,\text{s}^{-3}\bigr],\;
[k]=[\text{m}^{-1}].
$$

The only combination of $\varepsilon$ and $k$ with these dimensions is

$$
E(k) \;=\; C_K\,\varepsilon^{2/3}\,k^{-5/3},
$$

where $C_K$ is a dimensionless **Kolmogorov constant** (experimentally ≈ 1.4–1.7).

---

#### 3.  Physical meaning

* **Energy cascade**: large eddies transfer energy to ever‑smaller eddies without loss until the scales get small enough that viscosity dissipates it as heat.
* In the *inertial sub‑range* (where viscosity is negligible) the spectrum depends **only** on how fast energy enters/leaves that band (ε) and on the scale k—not on ν.

---

#### 4.  Velocity fluctuation at scale ℓ

From $E(k)$ one obtains the rms velocity associated with eddies of size ℓ ≈ 1/k:

$$
u_\ell \;\sim\; (\varepsilon\,\ell)^{1/3}.
$$

This relation (often called **Kolmogorov’s 2⁄3‑law** in structure‑function form) is fundamental in turbulence modelling and LES grid estimation.

---

#### 5.  Where the law is observed

* **Lab experiments**: grid turbulence, jet cores, wind tunnels at high Re.
* **Atmospheric surface layer**: inertial range spans several decades of k.
* **DNS / LES**: once Re and resolution are high enough, the computed spectrum collapses onto the $k^{-5/3}$ slope.

---

#### 6.  Limits of validity

* Breaks down at very **low Re** (no clear inertial range).
* Invalid near walls or in strongly **anisotropic**/inhomogeneous regions (boundary layers, shocks, swirling flows).
* At very high k the spectrum steepens due to viscous dissipation (Kolmogorov scale η).

---

**In a nutshell:**
Kolmogorov’s $k^{-5/3}$ law says that in the inertial sub‑range of fully developed turbulence, the energy density per unit wavenumber depends only on the dissipation rate and scale, giving a universal power‑law slope of −5/3.
