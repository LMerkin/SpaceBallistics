"Spikes" are due to Wall Functions =>
	to get rid of the "spikes" altogether (eg to enable automatic convergence ctl),
    switch off the Wall Functions (see below)

Computation of wall coefficients (y+) did not converge in TOO_MANY points =>
	decrease the "y+" value in Mesh generator

NB: If Wall Functions are NOT used, "y+" in the Mesh Generator should be <= 10,
  ideally y+ = 1, and sometimes y+ = 0.5.
  Small "y+" values result in very time-consuming iterations,
  but the number of iterations required for convergence decreases dramatically:
  say 30k for y+ = 30, 10k for y+ = 10, 1k for y+ = 5 :
  smaller y+ => less oscillations

y+ < 1 in TOO_MANY points (with Wall Functions) =>
	harmless, but may increase the "y+" value in Mesh generator

Local Divergence (say NaN encountered, with or w/o T_Wall < 0) =>
	Reduce CFL_NUMBER;
  sometimes, reduce WALLMODEL_RELFAC (?)
	if nothing helps, switch off the Wall Functions altogether
    (if so, may need to re-generate the Mesh with "y+" value <= 30)

Global Divergence (say large-scale oscillations, regular or irregular);
  perhaps the most common divergence case =>
	make sure the Mesh is good enough (may need to reduce y+ and the "s" ratio);
	also reduce CFL_NUMBER
