; Those params which are given explicit vals here will be kept constant in the
; optimisation process; all others will be treated as variables.

; In particular, if "payLoadMass" is NOT given a fixed value, it becomes not
; only an optimisation argument, but also the optimisation TARGET to be maxi-
; mised (provided that all constraints are satisfied). Otherwise, the target
; is the actual StartMass to be minimised (again, subject to constraints):
